# Pomodore Clock

 This project involves creating a Pomodoro timer with adjustable session and break lengths. Users can increment or decrement the lengths, start and stop the timer, and reset it to default values. The timer displays the remaining time in the format mm:ss and triggers a sound when the timer reaches zero. It also alternates between session and break periods, updating the timer label accordingly. The timer can be paused and resumed, and there is a specific audio element that plays a sound when the timer ends.
